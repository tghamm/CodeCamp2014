## Code Camp 2014 ##
This repo contains the presentation and code used in my 2014 Code Camp session.

>**Note:**  The angular code used in this presentation doesn't really follow optimal best practices in a few cases.  It's nothing horrific so it's still suitable for learning, but please do not consider this a copy and paste project.  I recommend John Papa's Pluralsight presention on Clean Code with Angular.  It does a great job of explaining the how's and why's of clean code in Angular.  If anyone cares to, feel free to update this code with IIFE's, separated files, controllerAs syntax, etc, that'd be swell.

### Installing the Database 
***CodeCamp2014.bak*** contains a full database backup.  Use SSMS to restore the database.  It will be called CodeCamp2014.

###Viewing the Slides
***CodeCamp2014_theme 1 with animation_final.pptx*** contains the slides used in the presentation.

***Slides.docx*** contains the slide and presentation notes used in the presentation.

###Running the Demo
Open ***RandomTriangleRestaurant.sln*** in Visual Studio 2012/2013.  Check the web.config to adjust the connection strings if necessary.  The committed config assumes that Integrated Security will be used against an instance named *.\SQLEXPRESS*

The ***Code Pastes*** directory contains the code snippets I used during the demo.  These are already pasted into the committed solution as well.
